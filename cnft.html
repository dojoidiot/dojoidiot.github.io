    <h3>the cnft collection</h3>
    a cnft is a code non fungible token. the cnft collection explores the questions - are cnfts feasible and what can
    you do with them? each cnft is designed to answer a particular question, and the answer to each question then leads
    to the development of the next question. we ask these questions using the zora.co media protocol.
    <h3>the questions</h3>
    <ol start="0">
        <li>question: how do we mint an html nft? this is not as easy as it sounds because the zora site does
            not allow file types of text/html to be loaded into the user interface. to answer this question we have to
            make our own program to mint our cnft artefacts and metadata. the cnft is a simple html page to see if we
            can first pass our own test of being able to do a successful mint.<br />answer: yes we can.

        </li>
        <li>question: do javascript, offscreen canvas sizing, and font size calculations work? this tests how the sizing
            and drawing works embedded in the zora site. the javascript is doing an off screen font
            size calculation, a containing div size calculation, and then determining the row and column count required
            to fill the space with chars printed as html. +/- are used as proportional characters of different width and
            height to see that it all works pixel perfect and no gaps or scroll bars appear. you can select the text to
            see that it is doing the font math and screen math correctly to translate from canvas font calculations back
            to web page placement. you can also resize the zora page to see if the calculations redo
            correctly.<br />answer: yes and no. yes on the desktop, but no on iphone.
