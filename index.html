    <h3>the cnft collection</h3>
    a cnft is a code non fungible token. the cnft collection explores the questions - are cnfts feasible and what can
    you do with them? each cnft is designed to answer a particular question, and the answer to each question then leads
    to the development of the next question. search for the dojoidiot at https://zora.co to find the
    cnft collection.
    <h3>the questions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>question</strong> can we mint a cnft? This is not as easy as it sounds because the zora site does
            not allow file types of text/html to be loaded into their user interface. To answer this question we have to
            make our own program to mint our cnft artefacts and metadata. <strong>answer</strong> yes we can. You can
            see it at https://zora.co/collections/zora/6337</li>
